This thesis attempted to measure the impact of the Federal Reserve’s communication methods on market expectations and reactions. 
Since investment algorithms are currently responsible for most of the equity market’s trading volume, the research focused on how AI 
reacts to the communication of the Federal Reserve. Given the complex relationship between Federal Reserve announcements and its effect 
on equity markets, an artificial neural network model was built to represent this relationship. 

Using a large collection of FOMC meeting transcripts and press conference transcripts, the model was trained. 
As a result, the model can differentiate the tone of the Federal Reserve accurately by 80%. 

Finally, the model’s performance was further tested with selected real-world examples. 
This indicates that AI has a superior understanding of the Federal Reserve’s communication methods than the public.
